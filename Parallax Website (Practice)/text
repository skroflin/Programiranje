What is parallax scrolling?

Parallax scrolling is a computer graphics technique used by
web designers to create a faux-3D effect.
As users scroll down a webpage, different layers of content or backgrounds
move at a different speed and this creates an optical illusion.
Using parallax scrolling has itself become a trend in the web design
world.

How do I make a parallax website design?

Diving into pure CSS to create it. Using container elements and
adding a background image to several containers.
You should then proceed to use the "background-attachment:fixed" CSS
property to create the actual parallax effect.
Another approach most commonly used; website builders to add parllax scrolling.
